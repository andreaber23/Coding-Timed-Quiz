## Usage

The instructions message will show, so that the user can be aware of the penalty of 10 seconds if they select an answer wrong. Once the "start quiz" button is clicked, the first question will be launched with 4 different choices. If user clicks on the right answer, no time deduction will be applied nor there will be a penalty. However, if user selects the wrong answer, the timer will be reduced by 10 seconds every time they click on the wrong one. Once user answers the last question, an "all done" section will appear, and user has to input their initial and click "submit". Then, they will be redirected to the highscore section where they can see all the highscores.
